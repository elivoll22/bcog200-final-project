I will be making a memory card flip game, using images from a folder that can be switched out easily for game modification.
The program will begin by providing instructions for how the game is to be played. I will be using a list to create card pairs,
and shuffle and arrange functions to mix the cards up each game and arrange them in a grid. I will be using a function to track
which cards are face up and which are hidden, so the game will play smoothly and keep track of which cards, automatically flipping cards 
when two many are selected or a matching pair is achieved. I will use a function to handle clicks, which will slip the card and
return its value, checking if two flipped cards are matched, and returning flipped cards that dont match back over. 
I will also use a function to keep track and store data, tracking matched pairs.
